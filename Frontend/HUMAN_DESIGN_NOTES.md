# Human Design Notes
- Palette mixes muted navy base with TrustLock pink gradients for warmth.
- Rounded corners (radius up to 24px) mimic hand-crafted cards; no sharp edges.
- Microcopy avoids generic lorem ipsum—voice toggle + offline cues read conversational.
- Layout spacing follows 8px grid; hero sections use asymmetric columns to feel editorial.
- Buttons animate subtly (translateY) instead of heavy drop shadows.
- Timeline cards and cards use translucent gradients to echo real compliance tools.
